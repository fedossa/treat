# In projects, you often need to provide user level data for the code
# to run. Examples are user names and passwords to access external
# data or paths to data that are stored outside of the project's
# directory. You need to inform the users what they are supposed to
# configuration here. A good place to do this is in the README.
#
# Here, we need the user to provide their WRDS access data as our toy
# project used WRDS.
#
# Edit and save this file(_secrets.yaml) as 'secrets.yaml'

# PLEASE NOTE: Anything that does not start with _ in the 'conf/secrets' folder
# is included in '.gitignore' so that it is not accidentally committed. NEVER
# commit usernames/passwords or similar sensitive data.

# If you would rather be prompted for your login info instead of having it written out, you can set prompt to true and save this file as instructed above.
prompt: false

# Alternatively, you can leave the prompt var to false and set your login details below.
